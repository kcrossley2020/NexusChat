     denial probability to 12%. Would you like me to update the claim?"
```

**Revenue Forecasting**:
```
User: "What's our expected net revenue for cardiology in Q1 2025?"
AI: [Runs time series forecast + regression model]
    "Forecasted net revenue: $4.2M ± $300K (95% CI). Key drivers:
     - 15% increase in procedure volume (interventional cardiology)
     - 8% decrease in commercial payer mix (Medicare shift)
     - 3% improvement in clean claim rate
     Would you like scenario analysis?"
```

**Patient Risk Stratification**:
```
User: "Which patients are high-risk for 30-day readmission?"
AI: [Runs risk stratification model]
    "Identified 147 high-risk patients (LACE score >10). Top 10 by risk:
     1. Patient #12345 - CHF, COPD, 3 ED visits last month - Risk: 92%
     2. Patient #23456 - Post-MI, non-adherent - Risk: 87%
     ...
     Would you like me to generate care coordinator task list?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Models run in Code Interpreter or via MCP to external ML services
- Results presented conversationally (no dashboards needed)
- Users can ask follow-up questions to understand predictions
- Actions can be taken directly from chat (update claims, assign tasks)

**Business Model**:
- **Base Platform**: $10K/month for predictive analytics access
- **Custom Models**: $25K-100K one-time fee to train org-specific models
